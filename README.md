# Pokémon Oracle Website

This is a small personal project I created for learning purposes.

It's a Flask application that determines what the user's "spirit pokémon" is via bucket hashing the user's name and birthday to a pokédex entry number. I used [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to obtain the pokédex and pokémon data.
